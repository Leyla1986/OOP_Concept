What is Abstraction?
        Abstraction means - unwanted data hiding.Showing only functionality to the user.Focus on what functionality does.Not how to does.

For Abstraction we are using abstract class and interface.

Why we use abstract class?
                     We donâ€™t want someone create objects from the abstract class.

Abstract Class:
         Abstract class can have abstract and non- abstract method.
         Abstract class can not be private and final.
         For declaration abstract class using abstract keyword.
         If a abstract class extend another abstract class,it does not have implement.
         Abstract class can have constructor.
         Abstract class follow instance or static variables.
         Abstract class can be child class
         We cannot create object from abstract class.

Abstract Method:
         You must implement abstract methods in first non-abstract class
         Abstract method needs implementation way over right abstract method first non-abstract class
         Abstract Method without body, abstract Method only in abstract class
         Abstract Method it does not have a body.The body is provided by the subclass.
         Abstract Method can not be static
